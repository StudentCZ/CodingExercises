# Challenge 4

## Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permuation of a plindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters.

### Example

Input: acer rac
Output: True (permutation : 'race car, care rac')

**Note: the string will be in lowercase and contains only letter. Do not count spaces.**
