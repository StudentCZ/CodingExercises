# Challenge 4

## Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal to x. The partition element x can appear anywhere in the correct partition. It does not need to appear between the left and right partitions.

### Examples

Input : 10 -> 1 -> 3 -> 6 -> 5 -> 2 -> 8 Partition = 5
Output: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5 -> 6 -> 8 -> 10
